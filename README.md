## JFD Website Architecture

JFD follows a structured architecture based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It includes the following components:

* **Controller Layer**: Handles incoming requests, delegates tasks to the service layer, and returns responses to clients. This includes endpoints for job listings and search functionalities.

* **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and coordinates tasks between the controller layer and the data access layer (repositories). It encapsulates operations related to job postings, searches, etc.

* **Repository Layer**: Manages database operations such as CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Uses Spring Data JPA to interact with the MySQL database.

* **Model**: Represents entities and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used within the application. Includes the `Job` entity.

* **View**: Utilizes Thymeleaf templates for rendering HTML pages on the client side. Templates are structured to display data based on user actions.

## Introduction
JFD is a project designed to provide a platform offering various jobs all over the USA for disabled people using the Java framework Spring Boot, connected to a MySQL database.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jfd.git
    cd jfd
    ```
2. **Set up the database**:
    - Create a MySQL database named `jobs`.
    - Create the necessary table within the `jobs` database: `job`.
    - Configure the `application.properties` file with your MySQL database credentials.

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash

    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

## Thymeleaf and Tomcat Configuration
* JFD utilizes Thymeleaf for server-side rendering of HTML templates and Apache Tomcat as the embedded servlet container provided by Spring Boot.

## Usage
1. **Access the application**:
    - Navigate to `http://localhost:9001` in your web browser.
2. **Search for jobs** by location or view all available jobs.

## Features
* Job listings across various locations in the USA.
* Search functionality to filter jobs by location.
* User-friendly interface with a dark theme for accessibility.

## Architecture

JFD's architecture is built upon modern web development principles, incorporating:

* **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot provides the foundation for robust backend services.
* **Database**: MySQL is used to persist data, ensuring reliability and scalability.
* **Design Pattern**: Follows a structured MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for clear separation of concerns.
